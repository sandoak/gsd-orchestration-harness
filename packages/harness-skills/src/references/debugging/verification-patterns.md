# Verification Patterns (DEPRECATED)

This reference has been consolidated into the `harness-debugger` agent.

**Location:** `agents/harness-debugger.md`

**Section:** `<verification_patterns>`

**Reason:** Debugging expertise is now baked into the agent. Loading separate reference files into orchestrator context was wasteful (~95% context reduction).

See `agents/harness-debugger.md` for the consolidated debugging methodology.
