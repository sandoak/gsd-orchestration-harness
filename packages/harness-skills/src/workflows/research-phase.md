# Research Phase Workflow

## DEPRECATED

**This workflow has been consolidated into the harness-researcher agent.**

The research methodology, tool strategy, source hierarchy, and verification protocols now live in:

- `agents/harness-researcher.md`

The `/harness:research-phase` command spawns the harness-researcher agent directly.

**Migration:** No action needed - the command handles this automatically.
