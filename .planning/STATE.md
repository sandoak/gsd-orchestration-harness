## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: 6 phases identified for v1.0 scope
- [Init]: Phase 5 flagged for research (checkpoint XML format)
- [01-01]: pnpm workspaces for monorepo (strict hoisting, fast installs)
- [01-01]: NodeNext module resolution, @gsd/\* path aliases
- [01-02]: Union types over enums for tree-shaking and flexibility
- [01-02]: Type-only @gsd/core package with no runtime dependencies
- [02-01]: Injectable executable option for testability (allows testing without Claude CLI)
- [02-01]: node:child_process over node-pty for MVP simplicity
- [02-02]: better-sqlite3 for sync API simplicity over async alternatives
- [02-02]: Raw SQL with prepared statements over ORM for performance
- [02-02]: WAL mode for better concurrency during dashboard reads
- [02-03]: Mark orphaned sessions as failed (cannot reconnect to running Claude CLI)
- [02-03]: recovery:complete event over logging (library consumers handle logging)
- [03-01]: Use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk subpath imports for ESM compatibility
- [03-01]: Inject PersistentSessionManager for testability
